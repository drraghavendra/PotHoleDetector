# PotHoleDetector

Potholes are serious concern issue in our country. People find it difficult to avoid potholes while driving. We are addressing this problem by building a pothole detector system and helping the drivers know about the road conditions by alerting them through maps.

We have built an android application which uses the camera and then calculates what percentage it is a pothole and pins the location to the map.

To detect potholes present in Roads via a camera mounted to public/private vehicles and intimate the corresponding authorities for necessary act.The System updates the Geo-Location of every potholes detected to a centralized data center with the image and severity.

The data in the data center is used to analyze Road conditions for immediate and prioritized actions.The Analyzed Report Lists the potholes in the most commuted roads and helps the authorities to decide the quickness of the action.
